During this COST Action a three day training school on working with weather radar data will be held in Rome from 20 â€“ 22 February 2017.

The international training school is designed for up to 30 participants, and aims to provide the knowledge and tools to allow you to use weather radar data for ecological research independently. The program combines lectures in the mornings, explaining the basics of (weather) radar and its applications in ecology, and afternoon practical exercises for people to gain hands-on expertise in processing, visualising and analysing weather radar data.
