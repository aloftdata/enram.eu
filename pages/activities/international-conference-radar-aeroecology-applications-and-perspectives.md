ENRAM will be organizing an international conference **“Radar aeroecology: applications and perspectives”**.

The conference will bring together meteorologists, ecologists, environmental consultants and diverse stakeholders. The aim of this conference is to showcase new discoveries in aeroecology, methodological developments supporting radar aeroecology and current applications for a range of stakeholders. The conference will include invited speakers, oral presentations and flash poster presentations and ample time for discussion.

The conference will be followed by a half day **MC meeting on 24 February 2017**. Minutes of the MC meeting can be [here](/assets/documents/Rome-MC-Minutes_Feb-2017.pdf).

We are happy to have the following speakers on board:

Keynote presentation: Prof. Thomas Alerstam (Lund University)

Invited speakers: Dr. Jeff Buler (University of Delaware), Dr. Robb Diehl ( US Geological Survey), Prof Hongqiang Feng (Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences), Dr. Elena Saltikoff (OPERA program manager, Finnish Meteorological Institute).

The conference will be preceded by a 3-day training school for ENRAM members. The international training school is designed for up to 30 participants, and aims to provide the knowledge and tools to allow you to use weather radar data for ecological research independently. The program combines lectures in the mornings, explaining the basics of (weather) radar and its applications in ecology, and afternoon practical exercises for people to gain hands-on expertise in processing, visualising and analysing weather radar data.

The conference organising committee:

Giacommo Del’Ommo (local organiser), Jose Alves, Silke Bauer, Nir Sapir, Judy Shamoun-Baranes
