ENRAM will achieve its scientific goals through the formation of four interdependent Working Groups (WG) which will last for the duration of the Action:

- [WG1: Classification and Retrieval of Biological Data from European Weather Radars](/working-groups/working-group-1/)<br>Working group leader: Adriaan Dokter
- [WG2: Improvement of Weather Radar Data Quality and Validation of Biological-classification Algorithms](/working-groups/working-group-2/)<br>Working group leader: Felix Liechti
- [WG3: Visualizing Spatio-temporal Patterns of Animal Movement](/working-groups/working-group-3/)<br>Working group leader: Hans van Gasteren
- [WG4: Significance and potential of Animal Movement Research](/working-groups/working-group-4/)<br>Working group leader: Ommo HÃ¼ppop

The WGs are interdependent on each other and so there will be consistent dialogue and frequent meetings between all WGs to enable exchange of information. The WGs will coordinate the publishing of joint research results in scientific journals and at scientific and stakeholder related conferences.
