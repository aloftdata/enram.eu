An integral part of the research conducted at ENRAM will be in the form of Short-Term Scientific Missions (STSMs). This is the exchange of scientific staff with a duration of 1 or 3 months. STSMs will be awarded to individuals who apply with a written proposal to dedicated members of the MC responsible for this aspect. Early-stage researchers are strongly encouraged to take part in STSMs. The following is an excerpt from the e-COST documentation regarding STSMs ([STSM](/assets/documents/STSM.pdf)).

For more information, please contact Dr Silke Bauer silke.s.bauer (at) gmail.com. Applications for 2016 should be submitted to Dr. Silke Bauer by **31 March 2016**.

## 2017

##### Verification of insect presence in raw data of radar wind profilers (3-7 April 2017, Germany)

The STSM was performed by Nadja Weisshaupt (Aranzadi, Society of Sciences, Spain) to extend the analysis and interpretation of time series data of radar wind profilers (RWP). In contrast to her previous work, the focus was on non-bird targets, both biological and non-biological. RWP signal characteristics were compared with echoes from cloud radars. The STSM was hosted by Volker Lehmann from the Lindenberg Meteorological Observatory, Germany. The final report can be downloaded [here](/assets/documents/STSM-Report_2017_Weisshaupt_light.pdf).

##### Data infrastructure proof of concept (16-20 January 2017, Switzerland)

These STSMs were carried out by Peter Desmet and Stijn Van Hoey from the LifeWatch team at the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) in Belgium and Liesbeth Verlinden from the research group Computational Geo-Ecology at the Institute of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. They were invited by Silke Bauer and Felix Liechti at the Department of Bird Migration at the Swiss Ornithological Institute in Switzerland and developed a proof of concept for an [ENRAM data repository for bird profiles](http://enram.github.io/data-repository/) - with functionality to transfer data from the BALTRAD FTP server to this repository - and extended the [bioRad R package](https://github.com/adokter/bioRad) to download and read data from this repository. They also provided technical advise for the [Western European flyway workshop](/activities/western-european-flyway-workshop/), which was held in parallel with the first three days of their STSMs. The final reports of these STSMs can be found here: [STSM report Desmet](/assets/documents/2017-02-16-STSM-report-Peter-desmet.pdf), [STSM report Van Hoey](/assets/documents/2017-02-16-STSM-report-Stijn-Van-Hoey.pdf), [STSM report Verlinden](/assets/documents/2017-02-16-STSM-report-Liesbeth-Verlinden.pdf). This STSM is part of the ongoing activities of [working group 3](/working-groups/working-group-3/).

##### Algorithm operationalisation in BALTRAD: upgrade and back processing (9-13 January 2017, Sweden)

The STSM was carried out by Liesbeth Verlinden (Universiteit van Amsterdam) and Matus Tejiscak (University of St Andrews) and hosted by Günther Haase (SMHI Norrköping). The aim was to update the Baltrad radar data processing pipeline, to ensure the availability of its outputs, to assess the archived data, and to develop a reliable method of back-processing archived raw data. The results suggest a range of further improvements in both data acquisition and processing. The final reports can be found here: [STSM report Verlinden](/assets/documents/STSMreport_LiesbethVerlinden_20170109-13.pdf), [STSM report Tejiscak](/assets/documents/report_matus.pdf).

## 2016

##### Real-time visualisation of raw weather radar data over the Netherlands and Belgium (28 November-3 December 2016, the Netherlands)

The STSM was carried out by Phillip Stepanian from Rothamsted Research, UK and hosted by Judy Shamoun-Baranes and Liesbeth Verlinden, Institute of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The final report can be downloaded [here](/assets/documents/stsmStepanianFinalReport.pdf).

##### The effects of fog on the flight behaviour of migrating Honey Buzzards as recorded by radar (14–26 November 2016, Israel)

The STSM was carried out by Michele Panuccio and hosted by Nir Sapir at the University of Haifa (Israel) and aimed to investigate the effect of fog banks on the flight behaviour of migrating birds. In particular were analysed data collected with surveillance radars at the Strait of Messina during spring migration. The preliminary results show that fog banks strongly affected number of birds migrating in the study area. Moreover also flight parameters were influenced by fog presence and in particular flight speed of migrating birds was faster during foggy time than with good visibility. The final report can be found [here](/assets/documents/Panuccio_STSM-Report2016.pdf).

##### RADAR study of gull movements in southwestern Portugal (30 October-5 November 2016, Portugal)

The STSM was carried by Dr Stavros Xirouchakis from the Natural History Museum of University of Crete (Greece) and was hosted by Dr Ricardo Tomé from the environmental consulting agency of STRIX (Portugal). The STSM aimed to improve radar ornithology techniques in monitoring bird movements and assess bird collision risk to onshore wind farms. The study species were the Yellow-legged gull (_Larus michahellis_) and the Lesser black-backed gull (_Larus fuscus_) which migrate along the west coast of southern Portugal every autumn. The STRIX BIRDTRACK® surveillance system was applied where an X-band marine radar, placed on a vantage point on a mountain ridge crossed by both gull species (Espinhaço de Cão Mountains) worked in horizontal mode. Radar data were validated by visual observations and processed by the STRIX Birdmonitor® software which incorporates signal-processing technology and advanced tracking algorithms that optimize automatic detection, tracking and classification of bird targets (i.e. automatic data grabbing, calibration and ground and weather clutter filtering). The main findings were that: a) species identification was impossible solely based on radar tracks thus ground truthing by visual observations will remain an essential complement to radar ornithology in the study area, b) bird speed or wing-beat frequency could not be used for distinguishing gull species  and form mixed flocks moving with energetic flight and same speed, c) there was poor evidence that gull numbers were affected by wind direction, d) habituation to wind turbines and avoidance might be more frequent in places where resident/ territorial species occur in contrast to species spending less time in wind farm areas when migrating, e) proper wind farm site planning should be considered as a conservation priority before proceeding to mitigating techniques such as wind turbines shut-down on demand.

##### Biological Echo CLassification in Dual-Pol Weather Radar Data (3-9 April 2016, Finland)

This STSM was carried out by Dr. Sevgi Zübeyde Gürbüz from the TOBB University of Economics and Technology, Department of Electrical-Electronics Engineering.  It was hosted by Dr. Jarmo Koistinen from the Finnish Meteorological Service and Dr. Matti Leskinen from the Universityof Helsinki.  The goal of this work was to examine dual-pol meteorological radar data from Hatay, Turkey and determine whether significant bird migration could be detected.  Furthermore, differences in dual-pol data obtained in Turkey versus that from Finland were considered, and the design of a naive Bayesian classifier investigated that could give robust results across geographies of significantly different climate and topology.
