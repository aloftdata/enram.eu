_Working group leader: Adriaan Dokter_

WG1 will assess and evaluate biological-classification algorithms on data from the European weather radar network, with the ultimate aim of ensuring consistent high-quality spatio-temporal information on animal movement intensity in the aerosphere above the whole of Europe and improving the quality of meteorological outputs.

At the first stage, data which is already collected from a few weather radars will be processed with the basic algorithm, reviewed and approved. Experts will assess output in joint meetings and determine whether specific modifications are needed for different areas in order to work towards optimised versions of the algorithm tailored to fit the specifications of individual weather radars. Refined bird algorithms will then be rolled-out across the entire network. National meteorological institutes will be motivated and supported to implement the algorithm for automated and routine data processing.

Later stages will focus on setting up protocols to coordinate research performed independently from the COST Action, by the single group members.
