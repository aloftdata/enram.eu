_Working group leader: Ommo HÃ¼ppop_

WG4 will review current knowledge and work out new and hitherto unanswerable research questions related to continental-scale animal migrations through the aerosphere, and define grand challenges and priorities to steer future research conducted by Action members.

They will evaluate the needs of the stakeholder communities as well as assess the applicability of recent findings in research and explore new research possibilities that will emerge from the previously unattainable data. By its very nature, the tasks of this WG are somewhat speculative at the moment, as many more ideas will surely emerge following results from other WGs. The activities of this WG will be re-evaluated by the MC during the course of the Action.
