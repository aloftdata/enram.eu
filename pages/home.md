ENRAM (European Network for the Radar surveillance of Animal Movement) is a research network whose activities were funded by the COST Programme (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) from October 2013 until October 2017. The Memorandum of Understanding can be dowloaded [here](/assets/documents/ES1305-e.pdf).

Researchers from across Europe and a wide range of expertise – including ecology, biogeography, ornithology, entomology, meteorology, mathematics and engineering – will join forces in the field of aeroecology to foster continental-scale remote sensing of animal migration for the first time. Thereby the already existing monitoring efforts and prediction of animal movement patterns can be coordinated and extended to a continental scale.

By establishing this coordinated network of international scientists and its multi-disciplinary approach ENRAM will consolidate Europe’s world leading position in the use of radar for animal movement studies, taking this area of science a major step forward.

While the COST Action has officially ended, the network is still functioning and generating new initiatives. One such initiative is GloBAM which involves several ENRAM members. The [GloBAM](/globam/) project website can be found at <https://globam.science>.
